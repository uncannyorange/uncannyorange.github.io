## CRIMSON 1.0
- Added crimson codes interface
- Added a code bar for all pages
- Fixed bugs:
[CRB-12] The CRIMSON app would not remember what page you were on after leaving for the home screen
[CRB-15] You would stay stuck on pages if you waited longer than 10 seconds before switching
[CRB-26] the color and font would not appear correctly and instead show the defaults
- Changed to the theme to be honeydew, crimson and font-family Menlo
- Changed the top-bar to match the color of the page, making it more like a native app
