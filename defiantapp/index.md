### CRIMSON PWAs
CRIMSON is the wicked and corrupted department of DefiantDev. The deal with thinks like "How could we cause a literal revolt within the REVOLT PWA?". And that's what they've done. <br/>
They are also masters of CSS. The pretty comes at a cost of participating in the corruption of this world. In my opinion, it's worth it.
